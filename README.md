This classic two-player game has been a favorite for generations, combining strategy, anticipation, and fun in a simple 3x3 grid. Whether youâ€™re looking for a quick break or a chance to challenge a friend, our implementation offers an intuitive and seamless experience for players of all skill levels.

In Tic Tac Toe, the goal is to be the first to line up three of your marks (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on the game board. Players take turns placing their marks in empty squares until one player wins or the board is completely filled, resulting in a draw.
User gets to choose their blocks one at a time and the one who forms all the three in a straight line or diagnol will be the winner.
